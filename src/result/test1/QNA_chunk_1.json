            "question": "What are the key features of the informal contract farming model?",
            "answer": "The informal contract farming model involves small firms entering into simple, seasonal production contracts with smallholders. Its success often hinges on the availability and quality of external extension services. Embedded services, if provided, are typically limited to the delivery of basic inputs, sometimes on credit, with advice usually restricted to grading and quality control.",
            "context": "Contract farming business models\nInformal model - This model is the most transient and speculative of all contract farming models, with a risk of default by both the promoter and the farmer\u201d (van Gent, n.d., p.5). However, this depends on the situation: interdependence of contract parties or long-term trustful relationships may reduce the risk of opportunistic behaviour. Special features of this CF model are:\nSmall firms conclude simple, informal seasonal production contracts with smallholders.\nThe success often depends on the availability and quality of external extension services.\nEmbedded services, if at all provided, are limited to the delivery of basic inputs, occasionally on credit; advice is usually limited to grading and quality control.\nTypical products: requiring minimal processing/ packaging, vertical coordination; e.g. fresh fruit/ vegetables for local markets, sometimes also staple crops."

            "question": "What types of products are typically associated with the informal contract farming model?",
            "answer": "The informal contract farming model typically deals with products that require minimal processing or packaging and vertical coordination. Examples include fresh fruits and vegetables destined for local markets, and sometimes staple crops.",

            "answer": "The informal contract farming model carries a risk of default by both the promoter and the farmer. However, this risk may be mitigated by factors such as interdependence between the contract parties or long-term trustful relationships.",

            "question": "Why is the informal contract farming model considered transient and speculative?",
            "answer": "The informal contract farming model is deemed transient and speculative due to its reliance on simple, informal seasonal production contracts between small firms and smallholders. This arrangement lacks the formal structures and safeguards found in other contract farming models, making it more vulnerable to opportunistic behavior and potential default.",
