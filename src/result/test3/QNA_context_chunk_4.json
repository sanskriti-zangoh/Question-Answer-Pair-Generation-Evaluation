Due attention has to be paid to possible political interferences.\nThis model may also feature as farm-firm arrangement complemented by agreements with 3rd party service providers (e.g. extension, training, credits, inputs, logistics).\nSeparate organisations (e.g. cooperatives) may organise farmers and provide embedded services (e.g. credits, extension, marketing, sometimes also processing).\nThis model may involve equity share schemes for producers.\nCentralized model - In this model, the buyers\u2019 involvement may vary from minimal input provision (e.g. specific varieties) to control of most production aspects (e.g. from land preparation to harvesting). This is the most common CF model, which can be characterised as follows:\nThe buyer sources products from and provides services to large numbers of small, medium or large farmers.\nThe relation/ coordination between farmers and contractor is strictly vertically organised."
