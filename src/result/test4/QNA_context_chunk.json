            "answer": "Contract farming is an agricultural production system where a buyer and farmers have an agreement that outlines the conditions for producing and marketing a specific agricultural product or products. The farmer agrees to provide agreed quantities of a specific agricultural product that meets the quality standards of the purchaser and is supplied at the time determined by the purchaser. In turn, the buyer commits to purchase the product and, in some cases, to support production through, for example, the supply of farm inputs, land preparation, and the provision of technical advice.",
