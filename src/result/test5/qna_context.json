        "question": "What is contract farming?",
        "answer": "Contract farming is agricultural production carried out according to an agreement between a buyer and farmers, which establishes conditions for the production and marketing of a farm product or products. Typically, the farmer agrees to provide agreed quantities of a specific agricultural product. These should meet the quality standards of the purchaser and be supplied at the time determined by the purchaser. In turn, the buyer commits to purchase the product and, in some cases, to support production through, for example, the supply of farm inputs, land preparation and the provision of technical advice.",

        "question": "What are the key characteristics of the informal contract farming business model?",
        "answer": "The informal contract farming business model is characterized by simple, informal seasonal production contracts between small firms and smallholders. The success of these contracts often depends on the availability and quality of external extension services. Embedded services, if at all provided, are limited to the delivery of basic inputs, occasionally on credit. Advice is usually limited to grading and quality control. Typical products produced under this model require minimal processing or packaging and vertical coordination, such as fresh fruits and vegetables for local markets or sometimes staple crops.",
        "context": "Contract farming business models\nInformal model - This model is the most transient and speculative of all contract farming models, with a risk of default by both the promoter and the farmer\u201d (van Gent, n.d., p.5). However, this depends on the situation: interdependence of contract parties or long-term trustful relationships may reduce the risk of opportunistic behaviour. Special features of this CF model are:\nSmall firms conclude simple, informal seasonal production contracts with smallholders.\nThe success often depends on the availability and quality of external extension services.\nEmbedded services, if at all provided, are limited to the delivery of basic inputs, occasionally on credit; advice is usually limited to grading and quality control.\nTypical products: requiring minimal processing/ packaging, vertical coordination; e.g. fresh fruit/ vegetables for local markets, sometimes also staple crops."

        "question": "What are the special characteristics of the intermediary model in contract farming?",
        "answer": "The intermediary provides embedded services (usually passing through services provided by buyers against service charges) and purchases the crop. This model can work if well-designed and if incentive structures are adequate and control mechanisms are in place.",
        "context": "Typical products: requiring minimal processing/ packaging, vertical coordination; e.g. fresh fruit/ vegetables for local markets, sometimes also staple crops.\nIntermediary model -  In this model, the buyer subcontracts an intermediary (collector, aggregator or farmer organisation) who formally or informally contracts farmers (combination of the centralised/ informal models). Special characteristics of this CF model are:\nThe intermediary provides embedded services (usu- ally passing through services provided by buyers against service charges) and purchases the crop.\nThis model can work, if well-designed and if incentive-structures are adequate and control mechanisms are in place."

        "question": "Describe the special features of the multipartite model.",
        "answer": "The multipartite model may feature joint ventures of parastatals/ community companies with domestic/ foreign investors for processing. Vertical coordination depends on the discretion of the firm. Due attention has to be paid to possible political interferences.",
        "context": "This model can work, if well-designed and if incentive-structures are adequate and control mechanisms are in place.\nThis model can bear disadvantages for vertical coordination and for providing incentives to farmers (buyers may lose control of production processes, quality assurance and regularity of supplies; farmers may not benefit from technology transfer; there is also a risk of price distortion and reduced incomes for farmers).\nMultipartite model - This model can develop from the centralised or nucleus estate models, e.g. following the privatisation of para- statals. It involves various organisations such as govern- mental statutory bodies alongside private companies and sometimes financial institutions. Special features:\nThis model may feature as joint ventures of parastatals/ community companies with domestic/ foreign investors for processing.\nThe vertical coordination depends on the discretion of the firm. Due attention has to be paid to possible political interferences."

        "question": "What are the key aspects of the centralized model in contract farming?",
        "answer": "The centralized model in contract farming involves the following key aspects:\n- The buyer sources products from and provides services to a large number of small, medium, or large farmers.\n- The relationship and coordination between farmers and the contractor are strictly vertically organized, meaning that the contractor has significant control over the production process, from land preparation to harvesting.\n- This model is the most common form of contract farming.",
        "context": "The vertical coordination depends on the discretion of the firm. Due attention has to be paid to possible political interferences.\nThis model may also feature as farm-firm arrangement complemented by agreements with 3rd party service providers (e.g. extension, training, credits, inputs, logistics).\nSeparate organisations (e.g. cooperatives) may organise farmers and provide embedded services (e.g. credits, extension, marketing, sometimes also processing).\nThis model may involve equity share schemes for producers.\nCentralized model - In this model, the buyers\u2019 involvement may vary from minimal input provision (e.g. specific varieties) to control of most production aspects (e.g. from land preparation to harvesting). This is the most common CF model, which can be characterised as follows:\nThe buyer sources products from and provides services to large numbers of small, medium or large farmers.\nThe relation/ coordination between farmers and contractor is strictly vertically organised."

The estate system involves significant investments by the buyer into land, machines, staff and management. This CF model can be characterised as follows:"

        "question": "What are the typical products and advantages of contract farming?",
        "answer": "Typical products of contract farming include perennials. Advantages include benefits for both farm-producers and agro-processing firms, including the efficient utilization of installed processing capacities and the satisfaction of firm sales obligations.",
        "context": "The nucleus estate usually guarantees supplies to assure cost-efficient utilisation of installed processing capacities and to satisfy firm sales obligations respectively.\nIn some cases, the nucleus estate is used for research, breeding or piloting and demonstration purposes and/ or as collection point.\nThe farmers are at times called \u2018satellite farmers\u2019 illustrating their link to the nucleus farm.
