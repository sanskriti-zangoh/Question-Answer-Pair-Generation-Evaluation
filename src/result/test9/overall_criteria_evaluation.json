        "answer": "Contract farming is a form of agricultural production where a buyer and farmers agree on the conditions for the production and marketing of a farm product or products. The farmer agrees to provide specific quantities of a product that meets the quality standards of the purchaser and is supplied at the time determined by the purchaser. In return, the buyer commits to purchase the product and may also provide support for production, such as supplying farm inputs, preparing land, and providing technical advice.",
